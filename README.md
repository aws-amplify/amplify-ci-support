## Amplify CI Support

This package provides scripts and tools for managing Amplify projects in
continuous integration environments, and for local developer setup of
integration test environments.

To deploy resources necessary to run the Android SDK's integration
tests, [see here](./src/integ_test_resources/android/sdk/integration/cdk/README.md).

To build a configuration file that can be referenced from an iOS/Android
device, [see here](./src/integ_test_resources/common/README.md).
